#Pick a random number between 1 and 100
#  - rand (1..100) with a variable

# Prompt you for a guess
#  - Ask to guess a number between 1 and 100

# If your guess is less than the program's number, it should tell you that you were low and let you guess again.
#   - if statement... separate from the higher than.

# If the guess is greater than the program's number, it should tell you that you were high and let you guess again.
#   -if statement again.

# If your guess is correct, the program should tell you that you win and then quit.
#   - if statement with an exit.

# After 5 incorrect guesses, the program should tell you that you lose.
#   - not really sure how to do this. add a count +1 for every if statement and if it equals 5 quit?
